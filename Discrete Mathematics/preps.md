# Discrete Mathematics

* Aptitude (Analytical + logical approach) is the foundation of discrete mathematics.

## Introduction to Discrete Mathematics:

* Set Theory
    * Sets and relations
    * Functions
    * Group Theory

* Graph Theory
* Mathematical Logic
    * Predicate Logic
    * Propositional Logic

* Recurrance Relation and Generating Function

### Pre-requisites 
* Permutation
* Combination
* Binomial Expansion

### Sets

* It is a well defined, <b><u>unordered</u></b> <b><u>distinct</u></b> collection of elements (Doesn't matter if they have any meaning or not.). <br> A = {1,2,3} = {2,1,3}<br> B = {1, 2, a, b, Jan, Feb} <br>

* <b><i>Elements of a set need not be of same type.</i></b>

* C = {1, 2, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2}, {3}}. <br> There are 5 elements in set C.

* <b><u>Cardinality</u></b> of a set is defined as number of elements in the set.<br> It is denoted by |A| given a set A.

* Cardinality of A = {1, 2, 3} is |A| = 3. <br> B = {1, {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, 3} is |B| = 5. <br> C = {} is |C| = 0.

* Empty set is also donated by <b>φ</b>(phi). Therefore C = φ.

<b><u>Interesting Notes</b></u><br>

If A = {{}} and B = {} is A = B? or A != B <br>

* A is a set containing an element and that element is an empty set. Therefore |A| = 1.
* But B is a set of no elements. Therefore |B| = φ
* Therefore A != B <br>

If A = {{{{}}}}, Then |A| = 1, as elements in a set are separated by ",". <br>. Therefore (lay man's terms) anything written inside the outer most {}, that set is not empty!

* A = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}} is not a set as {1, 2} == {2, 1}. Therefore A is not a set!
