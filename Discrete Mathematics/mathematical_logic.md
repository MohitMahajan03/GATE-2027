### Mathematical Logic

* It gives us power to check the validity of a statement.
* We use only Factual / Propositional Statements in Mathematical Logic.
* A Compound Statement, can be broken down to more than 1 propositional statements
    * Ex: X >= 3; which can also be written as X > 3 or X = 3

* There are words called as connectives that connect 1 or more propositional statements, they consist of Conjunctions, Disjunctions, Single Implication, and double implications.

* Modifier / Negater (~): These words modify the statements.

* Conjunctions :
    * AND/BUT (^) : <table><tr><th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p^q</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr></table>

* Disjunctions :
    * OR (v) : <table><tr><th>p</th><th>q</th><th>pvq</th></tr>
                <tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
                <tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr>
                <tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
                <tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr></table>

* Single Implication :
    * IMPLIES (->) :<table><tr><th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p->q</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr></table>


    if a -> b

    * Converse = b -> a
    * Inverse = ~a -> ~b
    * Contrapositive = ~b -> ~a

* Double implication (Biconditional) : a <-> b
    * (a -> b) ^ (b -> a) : <table><tr><th>a</th><th>b</th><th>a<->b</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr></table>

* If in any expression there is at least 1 true statement, then it is called as a Satisfiable expression

* If all statements in an expression are true, then it is called as a Tautology / Valid.

* If all statements in an expression are false, then it is called as a Contradiction / Fallacy.

* If not all statements are true and not all of them are false, then the statement is a Contingency

* All Satisfiable expressions are not Contingency
