## Introduction

### Block Diagram of a Computer System

* <img src = "Introduction to C/block_diagram.png">

* Humans provide instructions to the computer and the computer executes them.
* A program is sa sequence of instructions
* Computer understands only binary data also known as "Machine Language"
* Assemble language uses mnemonic instructions to represent machine code instructions.
* The assembly language is also called Low level language (as it is more closer to the hardware)
* It allows manipulation of hardware elements like register, memory etc.
* They also help in developing operating systems, device drivers and embedded systems.
* High level languages are programming languages which are understood by humans, Which uses letters and symbols to represent logic and instructions in a program.

* It uses english words and mathematical symbols rather then mnemonic codes.
* High level -> Assembly -> Low level -> Machine

### C Programming

* C is considered as a middle level language because it has features of both low-level and high level languages.

* It gives access to developers to manipulate the hardware, hence it is a middle level language.

* C is used to build system programs, device drivers, Compilers and assemblers, embedded systems, IoT devices, Application software, databases, Games, Networking protocols and web servers.
